# SAMPSkins

SAMPSkins.asi is part of a replacement project for codsmp.asi due to trust and safety concerns. SAMPSkins.asi provides you a way to use custom models per a player's skin.

In this release, only the following is supported: custom models must be in the format of John_Doe_X;
For example, Cake_Dev_1 replaces skin id 1 for player Cake_Dev.

Client commands added are:

- /models - lists all loaded custom models
- /model [name] - changes your own skin to the custom model
- /setmodel [playerid] [name] - changes someone else's skin to the custom model
- /reloadmodels - dynamically reloads the custom models
- /modelid - shows your original skin id

Files can be put in subfolders in the custom_models folder, for example:

- GTA San Andreas/custom_models/my own skins/Cake_Dev_1.dff
- GTA San Andreas/custom_models/my own skins/Cake_Dev_1.txd

**Weapons are not supported in this release and only 0.3.DL is supported.**
